Model used for BSc Thesis (Inequality and Environmental Taxation) by Ivan Alexeev and Mathias Mikkelsen

Purpose of files is as follows.

Solvers
- a_inner_solver.py finds the general equilibirum in the baseline model for a given vector of policy instruments.
- b_outer_solver.py finds the optimal vector of policy instruments in the baseline model.
- j_inner_solver_ext.py finds the general equilibirum in the extended model for a given vector of policy instruments.
- k_outer_solver_ext.py finds the optimal vector of policy instruments in the extended model.
